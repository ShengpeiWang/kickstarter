# kickstarter
Helping you set a realistic Kickstarter goal! Explore the app: [Sw-kickstart.herokuapp.com] (https://sw-kickstart.herokuapp.com)

## Motivation
I want to help entrepreneurs succeed in running Kickstarter campaigns, because I admire their courage and efforts in pursuing their ideas. The app predicts the amount a project would raise using their proposal information, and give custom suggestions on word choices for improvements. This was built in three weeks as an [Insight Data Science] (https://www.insightdatascience.com/) fellow. 

# Built with
- Python
- Streamlit
- Heroku

# Features
- Functions to scrape Kickstarter website using Selenium in Python (web_scrapping.ipynb)
- Copy of cleaned up data for analysis (pickle/project_data_complete.pkl)
- Code examples for natural language processing, tf-idf, and model selection (kick_project.ipynb)
- Source code for the streamlit app (app.py)

# Local setup
- Environmental dependencies are listed at the beginning of each code file.
- The project information can be found at [WebRobots] (https://webrobots.io/kickstarter-datasets/) website. I imported the JSON version into a MongoDB database for querying, you can also download the csv version if preferred.

# Feedback
