backend is up and xxunk finished one xxunk ( xxunk ) , for the second application we have a finished xxunk development of the xxunk app is on - xxunk main parts of our sdk are xxunk xxunk tool manufacturing and finalizing plastics xxunk tool manufacturing for the xxunk zero manufacturing regarding electronic , housing and xxunk xxunk app xxunk development e.g. tutorials , statistics xxunk and xxunk xxunk / 2018 - finish xxunk , xxunk , charge xxunk / 2018 - finish xxunk app , series xxunk / 2018 - xxunk with xxunk basic idea behind xxunk is to bring more sense in my xxunk can use the xxunk anonymous and offline . that 's important to us . if you create an online account , you have access to your data from everywhere and they are backed . our future goal is that our system and people are learning from the crowd . we enjoy tinkering with and building xxunk of other products we like . xxunk will let you have that experience , our goal is to provide a sdk for developers . we would love to hear your thoughts on what you might want to build with xxunk , how you could directly interact with the hardware and the data it xxunk xxunk the xxunk team , we combine the expertise of elite sports coaches with strategic it management and years of experience in game development . our university partners , such as the vienna university of applied sciences and the university of vienna , bring their scientific know - how to bear . with a good deal of creativity and effort , we have achieved something completely new to the xxunk more information see our website.the xxunk do n’t most people stay on the ball ? ” this is the question andreas xxunk ( ceo of xxunk ) asked himself when he observed that – despite the active involvement of the participants in his training sessions – the sessions themselves rarely led to a reduction in stress . in the absence of a personal coach , most of the participants simply xxunk motivation . why not make the classic anti - stress ball intelligent and turn it into a games controller ? listen to the whole story . awards and nominations xxunk gift xxunk xxunk is also a mindful gift for your loved ones , which can bring much relaxation and fun in their lives . we will provide you with a customizable gift card , which you can download , edit and put under your christmas tree . that 's all xxunk xxunk on facebook , youtube , instagram , twitter and our website . and lastly , thank you ; we ca n't wait for you to use what we 're building . supporter and partners * supported by xxunk impulse xl of the austrian federal ministry of science , research and economy , administered by xxunk,xxbos xxmaj ocean xxmaj alien xxunk want to film , record , and live stream 24 / 7 the lives and development of octopus in order to learn everything we can about xxunk , my name is john and for the past 2 years i have been eating up as much information as i can find on anything that has to do with octopus . as much as i have soaked up i have realized that there is still much more we have to learn about these amazing animals . my goal is to set up large 24 / 7 observation project where i can monitor , record , and stream live the lives of these animals in order to better understand them . a project of this size requires the assistance of someone who knows and understands xxunk marine life and who could help me set up and maintain the tanks . also , i will need to have a website to run the whole thing off of . then there is the actual equipment . costs add up quick and its simply just not feasible for me to chunk out all that capital from the jump . in the end i want to have something that i can share with everyone . i believe that we have a lot to learn from these creatures on our own planet that are nothing less than alien . however , this is something i 'm going to need all the help i can . anything that you can spare or help with will be greatly appreciated and put to good use . thank you for your time and consideration . donate or not always keep a health thirst for knowledge . xxunk r smith,xxbos xxmaj the xxmaj xxunk t - xxunk xxmaj xxunk need you to help us get t - shirts xxunk xxunk are band from xxunk , xxunk . after many requests for merch we have finally decided that it 's a good idea ! the only thing is that we ca n't afford to pay for the printing costs . this is where you come in ! every dollar helps . $ 20 + pledge will get you a t -

xxmaj finally great fitting plus size xxunk you recognize yourself ? xxmaj uncomfortable , xxunk and bad features at your everyday xxunk you recognize yourself ? uncomfortable , xxunk and bad features on your everyday xxunk vision is to develop everyday clothes that are adapted to fit the larger xxunk 10 years of experience and expertise in clothing for larger people , we see a shortage in what is delivered to the end customer today . the industry chooses to look away from large - scale people and create size models that become smaller and smaller . while most of us find it difficult to find clothes of a larger size . we have gathered all the stories that our customers have told us , and created a collection that should correspond to what 's xxunk the launch of xxunk voices xxunk be xxunk have listened to over 100 people who have sizes between xxunk xxunk . we have collected their thoughts and manufactured these 3 products for our first launch . stretch t - shirt we want you to feel comfortable . the t - shirt collection contains a basic model with a single - round neck , shorter and xxunk sleeves than today 's standard measurements available on the market . we have seen that the demand for shorter sleeves and garment length is higher than ever . the t - shirt model has a longer back than the front to minimize the risk of creating a gap between t - shirt and trousers . ( measured in xxunk xxunk the stories and wishes we have been told , it has been one thing in common . a jacket that you can wear every day , under all conditions . it must be warm , light , have breathability and a great comfort . it took us two years of designing and testing to get the ultimate result . this is our xxunk jacket - your every day buddy . ( measured in xxunk jacket your voice is paramount . we want to know what you want to wear . get in touch with us , participate and influence our future collections ! our most important elements are to create everyday clothes that are well - developed for a larger body . you have the answers ! contact us at xxunk with love,xxbos xxmaj help me fund my business , xxunk started making these bracelets to reduce my xxunk while sitting at home but i want to sell them at a local town xxunk was sitting at home at my grandma 's house one day and got bored so i decided to xxunk through her craft closet and try a few different things . well knitting did n't work and i still fail to this day and i tried making pillows but those never went anywhere so it was a few years later i was browsing the web and found stuff made of xxunk . instantly i was hooked and started learning . after a while i put it down so i could focus on school but have recently picked it back up after some encouragement from a nice man and his wife whom i 'd met at a local town fair . i 'd really like to get a spot near them next year and show my wares but with school and the job market xxunk being fairly thin , i do n't have the money to purchase materials and get a spot at the fair . so i 'm asking you , the kind , awesome , smart , and beautiful [ handsome if you prefer that ] people of kickstarter for help . at this moment i am able to offer half - persian 3-in-1 which is the weave shown in the picture , european xxunk , xxunk xxunk xxunk , and xxunk xxunk , but am always looking to expand what i know .\n",

specifically , this means that i need to raise money to cover the following expenses : paying gilad and colin ( i ca n't not pay the guys who made this music what it xxunk & mastering the record w / the great dave xxunk artwork and design w / jamie xxunk of xxunk xxunk for the record so that it can get reviewed / read about in as many places as xxunk new videos with the band !

this material is fantastic , it is so soft on the touch and the matt paper coating makes the color vibrant and clear - i 'd never imagined it would be this xxunk everyone ! my name is antonio xxunk , a 27 years old mechanical engineer with 3 years of experience in the field ( you may find more details on linkedin ) . the xxunk have always noticed how it is not easy for people with different cultural backgrounds to effectively communicate together . i wanted to facilitate xxunk , so i started taking concise notes to explain mechanical engineering topics in a simple way . i also started studying visual design so i could make better notes . this process lasted for 6 years , 3 of which in real - life job xxunk i want to helpi want to empower everyone in the world with the basic knowledge of mechanical engineering topics , and i want to do this with the help of clear , appealing visual design . that 's why i condensed this practical , easy - to - grasp mechanical engineering knowledge in a concise e - book . this short handbook ( 51 pages ) will be of most use to three main categories : with clean graphics and easy - to - grasp explanations , this book is a solid reference to look up to . by reading it before the in - depth university study , you will immediately grasp the underlying concept . also , you will understand what and how the things you learn will be useful to you in a future job . the last chapter also contains a brief guide to the most common work positions in the mechanical engineering field , so you can get a better idea of what real - life engineers do . as a product development engineer myself , i find it useful to have all the most important information to keep in mind during a product development process - and so will you ! from material properties to manufacturing methods , get handy information on the most common choices you will have to face during your xxunk effectively manage a team with mechanical engineers , one needs to have a general knowledge of the topic - what better way of having it than a clear and concise book ? also , relative time and costs for main applications are reported here , so to have some reference values . a peek in the content ... take a look at the structured index in the infographic below ! you will be presented the main mechanical engineering topics in a way that xxunk the phases of a product development process - starting from the materials ' choice , you will see how these are studied and processed into xxunk items , finally passing through the product design and validation . additionally , to readily access the most important information for each topic , i have created a so - called \" tab \" section which summarizes the chapter 's most important concept in a single page . these \" tab \" pages have a dark blue background , compared to the standard page 's white one - so that you are immediately focused on the content . find a comparison below : a standard chapter page , the one about materials . the most relevant information about the most common material classes ( metals , plastics , and ceramics ) are given in just a single , concise xxunk standard chapter page , the one about joining methods . the most relevant & practical information about this topic is given in just a single , concise xxunk the start of every chapter with a relevant quote !

in - the - clouds we want to return to some of our original inspirations for working with interactive media — as expressed , for instance , in the xxunk art xxunk think of xxunk - in - the - clouds as an ever expanding collection of virtual xxunk depicting scenes created for xxunk . the individual pieces will be available in a variety of digital media ( downloads , web , apps , video , etc ) . or they can be explored together in virtual reality ( vr ) in the xxunk xxunk . the subject matter for the xxunk is inspired by the medieval art that we find ourselves surrounded by in our home town of xxunk in xxunk of being xxunk , we ca n’t help being intensely moved by some of the religious art made during the gothic and renaissance period . these experiences ca n’t convert us to xxunk but they do make us think about universal themes as kindness , self - sacrifice , patience , empathy , love , and so on . we feel they make us better people . these experiences are intense and often accompanied by tears . and they last ! they stay with us , become part of us , tremendously improve our lives on this xxunk looking to transfer the intense experiences we sometimes have in museums to xxunk and the comfort of our living xxunk love visiting museums and churches in search of these experiences . but it ’s not always convenient to do so . and since there ’s all this wonderful technology now , it really should n’t be necessary anymore . we should all have works of art in our pockets or on our laptops , for when the mood strikes , or when we need a moment of calm and focus . on top of convenience , computer graphics running in xxunk are not confined to 2d static images anymore . now we can create scenes that are three - dimensional and alive ( and still fit in your pocket and can be shared xxunk individual xxunk in the virtual xxunk consists of a box that houses a life - size virtually sculpted body . often the body of a saint , or the virgin mary or jesus christ himself . the way that they are depicted always refers to some ancient tale . but do n’t worry , we ’ll make sure to explain the context of each piece , in case you ’re not familiar with this particular part of the story.the xxunk are alive . air flows , light shifts , insects xxunk around , wind affects clothes , xxunk move when breathing , and so on . accompanied by subtle , immersive sound effects . in many scenes an event will slowly unfold , from a beginning to an end . this should help you take the time needed for the contemplative effect . these are not casual experiences ! they are a form of meditation that require a certain state of mind that may take some effort or concentration to achieve . but it ’s so very much worth it ! such experiences can be life enhancers , sensation xxunk . they open our eyes and help us embrace and enjoy existence as it presents xxunk ? why xxunk have wanted to work with ancient religious themes for many years . but it ’s only now that we have figured out how to shape this desire . we think that , with your support , we can now bring something of real value into this xxunk the 20 years we 've been creating , projects and ideas with religious references continuously xxunk - in - the - clouds is intended to be our xxunk . we consider it to be a long term project that we want to continue to work on , perhaps for the rest of our lives . it is the ultimate art piece we want to create . beyond this we have no desires . i believe we have now achieved the experience and xxunk that can enable us to create a work of the xxunk we envision . there is no guarantee that we will succeed . but it is certain that we can not even start without your help ! would you like to be involved in one of the xxunk , ambitious , innovative and xxunk art projects of the century ? then pick your xxunk hosts : xxunk harvey & xxunk xxunk , creators of xxunk -

in - the - clouds will be xxunk after you , as one of the three sacred xxunk that form a holy trinity to watch over this most ambitious artistic endeavor . so if your name would be william , and the two others would be called robin and alice , xxunk - in - the - clouds will be xxunk to \" st william , st robin and st alice in the clouds \" . has quite a ring to it , would n't you say ? since you get the whole xxunk there would not be much point in making a chapel or a statue for you . but you will get everything else of course , we were just trying to grab some attention when we said \" none of the above \" . have our xxunk , xxunk xxunk - in - the - clouds is a huge project . much like the old xxunk , we will be building it bit by bit , starting with the choir , all the way in the east ( top of the map above ) . through this crowdfunding campaign we want to lay the foundations of the virtual xxunk and create two xxunk : one featuring eve with the snake from paradise and the other a holy virgin nursing baby xxunk , step by step we will expand and decorate the xxunk and add more xxunk -

in - the - clouds we want to return to some of our original inspirations for working with interactive media — as expressed , for instance , in the xxunk art xxunk think of xxunk - in - the - clouds as an ever expanding collection of virtual xxunk depicting scenes created for xxunk . the individual pieces will be available in a variety of digital media ( downloads , web , apps , video , etc ) . or they can be explored together in virtual reality ( vr ) in the xxunk xxunk . the subject matter for the xxunk is inspired by the medieval art that we find ourselves surrounded by in our home town of xxunk in xxunk of being xxunk , we ca n’t help being intensely moved by some of the religious art made during the gothic and renaissance period . these experiences ca n’t convert us to xxunk but they do make us think about universal themes as kindness , self - sacrifice , patience , empathy , love , and so on . we feel they make us better people . these experiences are intense and often accompanied by tears . and they last ! they stay with us , become part of us , tremendously improve our lives on this xxunk looking to transfer the intense experiences we sometimes have in museums to xxunk and the comfort of our living xxunk love visiting museums and churches in search of these experiences . but it ’s not always convenient to do so . and since there ’s all this wonderful technology now , it really should n’t be necessary anymore . we should all have works of art in our pockets or on our laptops , for when the mood strikes , or when we need a moment of calm and focus . on top of convenience , computer graphics running in xxunk are not confined to 2d static images anymore . now we can create scenes that are three - dimensional and alive ( and still fit in your pocket and can be shared xxunk individual xxunk in the virtual xxunk consists of a box that houses a life - size virtually sculpted body . often the body of a saint , or the virgin mary or jesus christ himself . the way that they are depicted always refers to some ancient tale . but do n’t worry , we ’ll make sure to explain the context of each piece , in case you ’re not familiar with this particular part of the story.the xxunk are alive . air flows , light shifts , insects xxunk around , wind affects clothes , xxunk move when breathing , and so on . accompanied by subtle , immersive sound effects . in many scenes an event will slowly unfold , from a beginning to an end . this should help you take the time needed for the contemplative effect . these are not casual experiences ! they are a form of meditation that require a certain state of mind that may take some effort or concentration to achieve . but it ’s so very much worth it ! such experiences can be life enhancers , sensation xxunk . they open our eyes and help us embrace and enjoy existence as it presents xxunk ? why xxunk have wanted to work with ancient religious themes for many years . but it ’s only now that we have figured out how to shape this desire . we think that , with your support , we can now bring something of real value into this xxunk the 20 years we 've been creating , projects and ideas with religious references continuously xxunk - in - the - clouds is intended to be our xxunk . we consider it to be a long term project that we want to continue to work on , perhaps for the rest of our lives . it is the ultimate art piece we want to create . beyond this we have no desires . i believe we have now achieved the experience and xxunk that can enable us to create a work of the xxunk we envision . there is no guarantee that we will succeed . but it is certain that we can not even start without your help ! would you like to be involved in one of the xxunk , ambitious , innovative and xxunk art projects of the century ? then pick your xxunk hosts : xxunk harvey & xxunk xxunk , creators of xxunk - in - the - clouds , with your xxunk will be making this entire project and all the individual pieces by ourselves . between the two of us , we have all the skills and experience needed to pull this off . we are looking forward to the long periods of intense and xxunk work to create these intricate pieces without the xxunk and stress that conventional team work xxunk started collaborating in 1999 — on a server called xxunk of all places . as xxunk ! we created hundreds of websites for numerous clients and several xxunk pieces that still find an audience xxunk 2002 we switched to making videogames . we ’ve published 8 games : the endless forest , the xxunk , the path , xxunk , xxunk , xxunk xxunk , xxunk xxunk and sunset . hopefully you ’ve heard of some of those . if you have n’t make sure you pick an award tier that includes them so you can start exploring our wonderful virtual worlds xxunk want to release all the pieces that come out of this project to the public for free . because we feel we should avoid commercial pressure when creating art of this xxunk . so we really need your support to make this work . backing xxunk -

virtual postcard to thank you for your xxunk « s a i n t l y » this is where things get serious . on top of all the trinkets above , we will honor your support of the building of xxunk - in - the - clouds exactly how this has been done throughout the ages : by putting your name on the eternal xxunk of the building . everyone who enters this xxunk hall will see how xxunk you xxunk « h o l y » we love living in xxunk , capital of the medieval county of xxunk , cradle of the northern renaissance and a fairy - tale like place to explore . and we live right next to the center of it all , just outside the former city xxunk . we invite you to come stare at the gothic xxunk of saint xxunk from our studio window in the attic of our home , a slender four story city house from the 19th century . next we will take you on a tour of the city and lead you around the interior of our beloved xxunk that has inspired us so much throughout the xxunk « c e l e s t i a l » in the xxunk days , kings and queens were buried in xxunk . many xxunk to this very day still have tomb stones instead of floor tiles . we will bury you in xxunk - in - the - clouds ! but since this is a virtual xxunk there 's no need for you to die first . we will simply make a beautiful tomb stone with a stylized rendition of your appearance and put it on the floor . an honor fit for a xxunk king or xxunk « a n g e l i c » a xxunk would be nothing without beautiful statues of saints . since we often do n't know exactly what these saints looked like , artists can take some xxunk in creating their likeness . so we hope that you would want to have your features xxunk as a holy man or woman . we can discuss any preference for the exact saint you might want to be depicted as . there 's many to choose xxunk « d i v i n e » xxunk - in - the - clouds will become the home for hopefully many art pieces over time . for each of these pieces a new chapel will be added to the virtual building . much like in the old xxunk , we will offer the opportunity to patrons to have a chapel of their own , dedicated to the saint of their preference , and decorated in a way that pleases them . the \" divine \" reward of the xxunk - in - the - clouds will be the first such chapel . and this is also the only time when this feature will be available at such a low cost . your very own chapel - in - the - xxunk « t r i n i t y » the xxunk - in - the - clouds will be xxunk after you , as one of the three sacred xxunk that form a holy trinity to watch over this most ambitious artistic endeavor . so if your name would be william , and the two others would be called robin and alice , xxunk -
